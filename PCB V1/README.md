# PCB V1
This is the first version of the PCB. It's setup to work with the ATmega16U2 and the BOM has quantities for myself so that I had extra parts when I ordered the components. 

### issues
Missing required resistors on data line for USB

### Notes 
Integrated OLED module on the board is untested. I dont have a reliable way to solder the ribbon cable from the OLED to the board for a secure connection yet. The left side of R8 connects to SDA of the OLED and the left side of R7 connects to SCL of the OLED.
